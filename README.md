We like to discuss and think forums are a great way to get in touch with your community.
With **Hourglass** we want to make it hassle-free and easy to host and administrate your own forum.
Hourglass is an adaptive, open-sourced forum system which tries to outperform competitive products by being simpler to use, administrate and develop for.
