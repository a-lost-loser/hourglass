We like to discuss and think forums are a great way to get in touch with your community. 
With **Hourglass** we want to make it hassle-free and easy to host and administrate your own forum. 
Hourglass is an adaptive, open-sourced forum system which tries to outperform competitive products and to be simpler to use and develop custom-built addons for.
